# Arqive - A Google Driveâ€“like web app for uploading, storing, and managing files in the cloud

I loved every minute I spent on this project, such a fun one. Prisma is indeed fun, I even used recursion for the first time in a real life scenario. 

I tried my level best to make it look as good as possible UI wise (used Vanilla CSS), even tried to cover all the functionalities I wanted to like the hamburger thing and the modal ofc. Overall really fun project and learned a lot.

Deployment went pretty smooth, I think I'm getting better at it hehe :p
